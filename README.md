| ID  | Contract Name          | Description                                           |
|-----|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| 01  | HelloWorld             | Basic contract to store and return a greeting string. |
| 02  | SimpleStorage          | Stores and retrieves a uint value.                    |
| 03  | Counter                | Increment, decrement, and get a counter value.        |
| 04  | Owner                  | Sets an owner address during deployment using constructor. |
| 05  | Greeter                | Stores a greeting; only owner can update it.         |
| 06  | Calculator             | Performs basic arithmetic operations.                |
| 07  | BooleanSwitch          | Toggles a boolean value on/off.                      |
| 08  | SimpleEvent            | Emits an event when value changes.                   |
| 09  | IndexedEvent           | Event with indexed parameters for filtering.         |
| 10  | RequireExample         | Demonstrates `require` for input validation.         |
| 11  | AssertExample          | Uses `assert` to enforce invariants.                 |
| 12  | RevertExample          | Uses `revert` with custom messages.                  |
| 13  | CustomError            | Defines and uses a custom error.                     |
| 14  | ViewPureFunctions      | Demonstrates `view` and `pure` modifiers.            |
| 15  | SimpleLoop             | Loops through numbers to compute a sum.              |
| 16  | Conditional            | Uses if/else logic based on input.                   |
| 17  | EtherUnits             | Converts between Wei, Gwei, and Ether.               |
| 18  | TimeUnits              | Uses seconds, minutes, hours, etc.                   |
| 19  | BlockInspector         | Reads block properties like timestamp.               |
| 20  | MsgInspector           | Reads `msg.sender` and `msg.value`.                  |
| ... | ...                    | ... (Continue up to 100)                             |
